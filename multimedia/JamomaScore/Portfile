description         Jamoma Frameworks for OSSIA Score

long_description    The Score framework is based on the Jamoma Foundation which allows \
                    to setup a Peer Object Model mechanism in order to embedded easily \
                    the features inside many programmation environments (such as Max) \
                    or inside specific application dealing with logical and temporal constraints.\
                    It also provides a tree structure to manage the namespace of an application \
                    in order to organize and access its services.
