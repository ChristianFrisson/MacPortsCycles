description         i-score is an interactive intermedia sequencer

long_description    i-score is independent of the devices it controls: \
                    these can be of such different natures as a set of light controls, \
                    a video streaming software, or a sample repository, \
                    these devices can also all be present simultaneously in a script. \
                    All messages in i-score are abstract (devoid of language or coding \
                    constraints), and can be sent on a network of devices, \
                    through several communication protocols.
